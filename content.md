# Get to know me

James Garcia

## Who I Am

I am an experienced developer with over 7 years working in the Austin, TX area who has a passion for making the entire software development lifecycle simply better. Whether it is for my immediate team or for the customers I support my teams practice and promote DevOps methodology, learning about what makes development organizations productive and placing focus on key aspects that need improvement.

We work to reduce and prevent technical debt by automating where possible, and we do our due diligence to ensure the value of what we are working on can be realized by the business.

## Ask Me...

...anything you would like to know, whether it is personal or work related. I will try to give you a few details below, but if you would like to have a conversation about how I like to work, what I like to do in my free time, or what my passions are, feel free to ask anytime.

## How I Enjoy Working

We work in a mix of office and remote settings. About 10% of my team is located in the office, but the remainder of the team and the customers we support are remote, in locations all over the world. I am comfortable in either setting, but have placed a lot of focus on maturing in the remote space with our ChatOps solution due to the benefits it provides:

- Reduction of tribal knowledge
    - Faster Onboarding
- Data on-demand (static, programmatic, API-driven, etc)
- API Integrations with Dev tools (GitHub, Jenkins, Artifacts, Defect/Requirement Tracking, Knowledge-base integration, PaaS interaction, etc)
- A multithreaded chat solution like Flowdock can keep conversations relevant
- Can replace email/Skype for Business
    - Developer communication with these legacy tools is not effective in many ways
- Properly formatted text, images, screenshots, etc
    - Instant images and animations (GIFs) can bring huge value to a conversation
- Persistent Chat
- Mobile App Accessible
- Pro-active alerts with [hubot](https://hubot.github.com)
    - An interactive, 24/7 employees

There are multiple ChatOps tools available, I have personally used Slack and Flowdock frequently.

Documentation is another key aspect of my work. I claim to have exceptional technical and non-technical writing abilities, and constantly apply writing to everything I do. This includes how-to's, implementation steps, training material, etc. Lately I have focused on writing Markdown-formatted documents on our internal GitHub Enterprise instance.
