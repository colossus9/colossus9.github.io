    <h3><a id="who-i-am" class="anchor" href="#who-i-am" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>I am an experienced developer with over 7 years working in <b>Austin, TX</b> who has a strong sense of empathy leading world-wide teams to implement and support enterprise-grade software development solutions. Whether it is for my immediate team or for the customers I support, my teams practice/promote <a href="https://devops.com/the-holistic-nature-of-devops-architecture-and-methodology/">DevOps</a> methodology and learn about what makes development organizations productive and placing focus on key aspects that need improvement.</p>
    <p>We work to eliminate technical debt by <b>automating where possible</b>, and we do our due diligence to ensure the value of what we are working on can be realized by the business. This work includes (but is not limited to) <b>individual technical contributions (writing code, building SDLC pipelines), holding architectural reviews with management, presenting deep technical material at a high level to both peers and management, and speaking directly to customers about solutions</b>.</p>
    <p>I have <b>two outstanding children under 5 and a lovely wife in the educational field</b> that I am immensely proud of. They have been hugely supportive of me as I have traveled the world and worked with people from all backgrounds to talk about adapting or transforming their workflows, including the adoption of DevOps/ChatOps. My line of thinking is definitely broadened and empowered with the perspectives they provide me. Understanding how my children learn and being involved with my wife's classroom sheds light on the potential that can be accomplished with <b>effective communication</b>.</p>
    <p>I admittedly have not been very active on social media due to the fact I <b>enjoy talking directly to folks</b> or prefer writing technical content for distribution, although I am absolutely open to the idea. I have an <b>optimistic outlook</b> on work and personal items and enjoy looking for ways to make life <strong>better</strong> for both.</p>
