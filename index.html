    <h1><a id="who-i-am" class="anchor" href="#who-i-am" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who I Am</h1>
    <p>I am an experienced developer with over 7 years working in <a href="http://www.austintexas.org/mapexplorer/" target="_blank">Austin, TX</a> who has a strong sense of empathy leading world-wide teams to implement and support enterprise-grade software development solutions. Whether it is for my immediate team or for the customers I support, my teams practice/promote <a href="https://devops.com/the-holistic-nature-of-devops-architecture-and-methodology/" target="_blank">DevOps</a> methodology and learn about what makes development organizations productive and placing focus on key aspects that need improvement.</p>
    <p>We work to eliminate technical debt by <strong>automating where possible</strong>, and we do our due diligence to ensure the value of what we are working on can be realized by the business. This work <strong>includes</strong> (but is not limited to) individual technical contributions (writing code, building SDLC pipelines), holding architectural reviews with management, presenting deep technical material at a high level to both peers and management, and speaking directly to customers about solutions.</p>
    <p>I have <strong>two outstanding children under 5 and a lovely wife in the educational field</strong> that I am immensely proud of. They have been hugely supportive of me as I have traveled the world and worked with people from all backgrounds to talk about adapting or transforming their workflows, including the adoption of DevOps/ChatOps. My line of thinking is definitely broadened and empowered with the perspectives they provide me. Understanding how my children learn and being involved with my wife's classroom sheds light on the potential that can be accomplished with <strong>effective communication</strong>.</p>
    <p>I admittedly have not been very active on social media due to the fact I <strong>enjoy talking directly</strong> to folks or prefer writing technical content for distribution, although I am absolutely open to the idea. I have an <strong>optimistic outlook</strong> on work and personal items and enjoy looking for ways to make life <strong>better</strong> for both.</p>
    <br>

    <br>

    <h1><a id="ask-me" class="anchor" href="#ask-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ask Me...</h1>
    <p>...<strong>anything</strong> you would like to know, whether it is personal or work related. I will try to give you a few details below, but if you would like to have a conversation about how I like to work, what I like to do in my free time, or what my passions are, feel free to ask <strong>anytime</strong>.</p>
    <p>My specific goals are not necessarily tied to an individual "type" of work, but rather I strive to understand the needs of a team and how I can apply my expertise to drive solutions, even if it is individual technical work or a higher-level architectural role.</p>

    <h1><a id="how-i-enjoy-working" class="anchor" href="#how-i-enjoy-working" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I Enjoy Working</h1>
    <p>We work in a mix of office and remote settings. About 10% of my team is located in the office, but the remainder of the team and the customers we support are remote, in locations all over the world. I am comfortable in either setting (especially in an <strong>asynchronous</strong> conversation-based environment), and have placed a lot of focus on maturing in the remote space with our <strong>ChatOps</strong> solution due to the benefits it provides:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduction of tribal knowledge</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster Onboarding of new team members</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Data on-demand (static, programmatic, API-driven, etc)</li>
      <li>API Integrations with Dev tools (GitHub, Jenkins, Artifacts, Defect/Requirement Tracking, Knowledge-base integration, PaaS interaction, etc)</li>
      <li>A multithreaded chat solution like Flowdock can keep conversations relevant</li>
      <li>Can replace email/Skype for Business</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Developer communication with these legacy tools is not effective in many ways</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Properly formatted text, images, screenshots, etc</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Instant images and animations (GIFs) can bring huge value to a conversation</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Persistent Chat</li>
      <li>Mobile App Accessible</li>
      <li>Pro-active alerts with <a href="https://hubot.github.com" target="_blank">hubot</a></li>
        <ul>
          <li>An interactive, 24/7 employee</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>There are multiple ChatOps tools available, I have personally used <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> and <a href="https://www.flowdock.com" target="_blank">Flowdock</a> frequently.</p>

    <p><strong>Documentation</strong> is another key aspect of my work. Technical work cannot be valued unless it is articulated correctly. I can claim to have exceptional technical and non-technical writing abilities, and I constantly apply writing to everything I do. This includes how-to's, implementation steps, training material, etc. Lately I have focused on writing Markdown-formatted documents on our internal GitHub Enterprise instance.</p>

    <p>I have had the privilege of serving in multiple roles and capacities over the course of my career and am always looking to apply and expand my expertise. <strong>Some of the roles</strong> I have served in includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Evangelist of GitHub Enterprise, DevOps Methodology and ChatOps</li>
      <li>Business Liason, listening to requirements</li>
      <li>Innovator/Developer</li>
      <li>Vendor Relationships</li>
      <li>Customer Service</li>
      <li>Software Development Lifecycle</li>
      <li>Escalations and firedrill reactions</li>
      <li>Technical Writing and documentation</li>
      <li>Relationship with people from many backgrounds and locations all over the world</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I enjoy working with people from all over the world and always show <strong>empathy</strong> to those who I can make an impact on.</p>

    <h1><a id="interests-and-hobbies" class="anchor" href="#interests-and-hobbies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <p><strong>For work interests and hobbies,</strong> I am interested in learning about the latest relevant technologies to enable development teams to move at the speed of business. The definition of a developer from my perspective has evolved to include many concepts...no longer is a high-performing developer only involved in coding and database work. To be a high-performing developer, you must also have proficiency in business analysis, automated testing, infrastructure as code, security minded, operations/support, user experience, etc.</p>

    <p>Traditional thinking when it comes to designing a solution tends to look something like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Visual</li>
      <li>Interaction</li>
      <li>Logic</li>
      <li>Data</li>
      <li>Infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The terms "front-end" tend to apply to Visual/Interaction while "back-end" tends to apply to Data/Infrastructure. Then, the Logic layer tends to be an integration to form a sort of "Technologist" role where things like APIs and magic happens to fit the two together. Rather than thinking in these terms, applying full-stack design thinking would free up a developer's mind to focus on the solution-centric design rather than only the user-centric outcome.</p>

    <p>I enjoy reading other developer blogs to gain insight, attending conferences to hear about new trends, and listening to developer pain points to attempt to come up with solutions. For example, lately I have been looking to reduce infrastructure costs a la OpenStack and Docker containers. I am also a data-driven person, in which I like to make decisions based on data vs. assumptions, and will work to data mine where I can to make more informed decisions.</p>

    <p><strong>For personal interests and hobbies,</strong> my top priority is my family. They are what drives me to go further, they support me in what I do and I work to teach them concepts from the technology industry.</p>

    <p>We like to travel when possible for work or leisure in any capacity (hiking, driving, flying, sight-seeing, etc). We have used the opportunities in the locations described above to see once-in-a-lifetime landmarks and hope to make it back to those places with the full family soon!</p>

    <p>In terms of hobbies, great question! Cars are most likely my favorite...my in-laws live nearby and are Corvette enthusiasts. One day I hope to get a toy I can play with <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

    <p>I enjoy a variety of sports and cheer for my Texas-based college/professional teams, including basketball, baseball, soccer and football. My favorite sport is college football. When given a chance, I will play in any sport on a team...some say I can be quite competitive...</p>
